# Description:	  This file serves as a preconfiguration file for debian-installer. It provides answers to questions asked during the installation of Debian automating the whole process.

# The general format of a line in a preconfiguration file is the following: <owner> <question name> <question type> <value>.


### Localization

# The values for setting locale can be preseeded individually by specifying language, country and encoding for greater flexibility.
d-i debian-installer/language string en
d-i debian-installer/country string US
d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US.UTF-8

# Keyboard selection.
# Select keyboard architecture to be PC-style keyboard
d-i console-tools/archs select at
# Select the keymap to use
d-i console-keymaps-at/keymap select us

d-i base-installer/keyboard-configuration/variant select USA 
d-i keyboard-configuration/variant select USA 


### Network configuration

# Note: auto selected as a boot parameter
# netcfg will choose an interface that has link if possible. This makes it
# skip displaying a list if there is more than one interface.
# d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto
# To pick a particular interface instead:
d-i netcfg/choose_interface select eth0

# Do not auto-configure network with DHCP.
d-i netcfg/use_dhcp boolean false

# If you prefer to configure the network manually, uncomment this line and
# the static network configuration below. 
d-i netcfg/disable_dhcp boolean true 

# Allow the preconfiguration file to work on systems either with or
# without a dhcp server.
# d-i netcfg/dhcp_failed note
d-i netcfg/dhcp_options select Configure network manually

# Static network configuration.
d-i netcfg/get_nameservers string 132.161.196.22 132.161.196.29 132.161.10.60
# d-i netcfg/get_ipaddress string 132.161.19x.xxx
d-i netcfg/get_netmask string 255.255.254.0
d-i netcfg/get_gateway string 132.161.196.1
d-i netcfg/confirm_static boolean true

# Note: sometimes the domain name varies (math.grinnell.edu).
# Any hostname and domain names assigned from dhcp take precedence over
# values set here. However, setting the values still prevents the questions
# from being shown, even if values come from dhcp.
# So leave these lines commented out.
# d-i netcfg/get_hostname string bourbaki
# d-i netcfg/get_domain string cs.grinnell.edu

# Disable WEP key dialog.
d-i netcfg/wireless_wep string

# If non-free firmware is needed for the network or other hardware, you can
# configure the installer to always try to load it, without prompting. Or
# change to false to disable asking.
d-i hw-detect/load_firmware boolean true

### Mirror settings

# Select the protocol to use 
d-i mirror/protocol string http
# Select manual for country to use local mirror
d-i mirror/country string manual
# Enter Debian archive mirror hostname
d-i mirror/http/hostname string mirror.cs.grinnell.edu
# Select local mirror directory
d-i mirror/http/directory string /debian/
# HTTP proxy information (blank for none)
d-i mirror/http/proxy string

# Suite to install.
d-i mirror/codename string squeeze

# Suite to use for loading installer components (optional)
d-i mirror/udeb/codename string squeeze

### Clock and time zone setup

# Controls whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC.
d-i clock-setup/utc boolean true

# You may set this to any valid setting for $TZ; see the contents of
# /usr/share/zoneinfo/ for valid values.
d-i time/zone string US/Central

# Controls whether to use NTP to set the clock during the install
d-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true
# NTP server to use. 
d-i clock-setup/ntp-server string time.cs.grinnell.edu

### Partitioning

## Partitioning example

# The method to use.
# The presently available methods are:
# - regular: use the usual partition types for your architecture
# - lvm:     use LVM to partition the disk
# - crypto:  use LVM within an encrypted partition
# d-i partman-auto/method string regular

# You can put an entire recipe into the preconfiguration file in one
# (logical) line. This example creates a small /boot partition, suitable
# swap, and uses the rest of the space for the root partition:
# 
# d-i partman-auto/expert_recipe string                         \
#       boot-root ::                                            \
#               150 200 300 ext3                                \
#                       $primary{ } $bootable{ }                \
#                       method{ format } format{ }              \
#                       use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext3 }    \
#                       mountpoint{ /boot }                     \
#               .                                               \
#               64 512 300% linux-swap                          \
# 		      $primary{ }			      \
#                       method{ swap } format{ }                \
#               .                                               \
#               10000 10000000 -1 ext3                          \
# 		      $primary{ }                             \
#                       method{ format } format{ }              \
#                       use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext3 }    \
#                       mountpoint{ / }                         \
#              .

# This makes partman automatically partition without confirmation, provided
# that you told it what to do using one of the methods above.
# d-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true
# d-i partman/choose_partition select finish
# d-i partman/confirm boolean true
# d-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true

## Controlling how partitions are mounted
# The default is to mount by UUID, but you can also choose "traditional" to
# use traditional device names, or "label" to try filesystem labels before
# falling back to UUIDs.
# d-i partman/mount_style select uuid

### Base system installation

# Configure APT to install recommended packages by default. 
d-i base-installer/install-recommends boolean true

# Select the initramfs generator used to generate the initrd for 2.6 kernels.
d-i base-installer/kernel/linux/initramfs-generators string initramfs-tools yaird

# The kernel image (meta) package to be installed; "none" can be used if no
# kernel is to be installed.
d-i base-installer/kernel/image string linux-image-2.6-686

### Account setup

# Create a root account.
d-i passwd/root-login boolean true
# Do not create a normal user account.
d-i passwd/make-user boolean false

# Root password, either in clear text
# user-setup-udeb passwd/root-password password xxxxxxxx
# user-setup-udeb passwd/root-password-again password xxxxxxxx
# or encrypted using an MD5 hash.
#d-i passwd/root-password-crypted password [MD5 hash]

# Note: normal user account might be needed if root's password is not set correctly- therefore leaving here commented out
# To create a normal user account.
# d-i passwd/user-fullname string Debian User
# d-i passwd/username string debian
# Normal user's password, either in clear text
# d-i passwd/user-password password debian
# d-i passwd/user-password-again password debian
# or encrypted using an MD5 hash.
#d-i passwd/user-password-crypted password [MD5 hash]

# Disable shadow passwords
d-i passwd/shadow boolean false

### Apt setup

# Install non-free and contrib software.
d-i apt-setup/non-free boolean true
d-i apt-setup/contrib boolean true

# Use a network mirror.
d-i apt-setup/use_mirror boolean true
d-i apt-setup/no_mirror boolean false

# Select which update services to use; define the mirrors to be used.
# Values shown below are the normal defaults.
d-i apt-setup/services-select multiselect security
d-i apt-setup/security_host string security.debian.org

### Package selection

# Choose software to be installed
tasksel tasksel/first multiselect Graphical desktop environment, Standard system utilities

# Whether to upgrade packages after debootstrap.
# Allowed values: none, safe-upgrade, full-upgrade
# Note: set according to wheeler's preseed.cfg
d-i pkgsel/upgrade select safe-upgrade

# Some versions of the installer can report back on what software you have
# installed, and what software you use. The default is not to report back,
# but sending reports helps the project determine what software is most
# popular and include it on CDs.
d-i popularity-contest/participate boolean false

#At this point, a question of keyboard keymap variants has come up. 
#The line below has been added to potentially address this issue.
d-i keyboard-configuration/variant select USA
d-i base-installer/keyboard-configuration/variant select USA


### Boot loader installation

# With a few exceptions for unusual partitioning setups, GRUB 2 is now the
# default. If you need GRUB Legacy for some particular reason, then
# uncomment this:
d-i grub-installer/grub2_instead_of_grub_legacy boolean true

# Note: The following line will need to vary on single and dual-boot machines. Uncomment the "with_other_os" option to install on dual-boot.
# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the MBR
# if no other operating system is detected on the machine.
d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true

# This one makes grub-installer install to the MBR if it also finds some other
# OS, which is less safe as it might not be able to boot that other OS.
d-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true

# No password for grub 
# Optional password for grub, either in clear text
#d-i grub-installer/password password pass
#d-i grub-installer/password-again password pass
# or encrypted using an MD5 hash, see grub-md5-crypt(8).
#d-i grub-installer/password-crypted password $1$SEQug/$FEuagRB2ohA6ybrM4I5Q8/

### Finishing up the installation

# Avoid that last message about the install being complete.
# d-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note

#### Advanced options

# This command is run just before the install finishes, but when there is
# still a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it
# directly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install
# packages and run commands in the target system.
# Get these scripts from hurd and run them at the end of the installation
# d-i preseed/late_command string wget http://132.161.196.22/d-i/configure_root.sh -O /tmp/configure_root.sh; chmod +x /tmp/configure_root.sh; /tmp/configure_root.sh
